git init
git add . (adds everything or can be specific files)
git status (shows all the files ready to be commited)
git commit -m "my message here" (commits all the files added)
git remote add origin https://github.com/liamriles/chapterbook.git (sets the repository destination)
git push -u origin master (actually pushes the code to the set repository)


you can then make changes to the code and commit the files
e.g git commit chapter3.txt -m "updates to just chapter 3"
git push -u orgin master (to continue to push to the repository)
